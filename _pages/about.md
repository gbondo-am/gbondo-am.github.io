### Software and Skills

#### Hydrology and Hydrogeology
Professionally involved in the water sector since 2017 as a Supervision Consultant, I developed technical and administrative skills through surveys, design, and supervision of water points such as borewells, mini dams, rainwater harvesting schemes, and liaising with stakeholders. During my Master's training, I acquired expertise in water sampling and using software such as Hydrus, SWMM, AQTESOLV, MODFLOW-Model Muse, PHREEQC, and SWAT for modeling and analyzing water data.

#### Geoscience and GIS
With a background in Geoscience, I work with geological and hydrogeological data and am proficient with tools such as GOCAD/SKUA and GeoDin. I have an intermediate level of expertise in Google Earth Engine and am competent with various ArcGIS Pro toolboxes for digitizing, georeferencing, and geostatistical modeling. Over the past two years, I have explored several ArcGIS products including ArcGIS Online, Survey123, Dashboards, and StoryMaps.

#### Programming and Data Science
Experienced in Python programming and Data Science applications in water, environmental, and geoscience tasks, I have varying experience in developing and deploying machine learning and deep learning models for prediction, forecasting, and image detection, either for Industry or for research. I am also proficient in web programming for web mapping, using GeoServer and Leaflet, and managing data with MySQL and PostgreSQL/PostGIS.

#### Automation with Python
I am also skilled in creating PDF automation scripts, data cleaning scripts, and custom Streamlit apps.

### Personal Interests
Outside of my professional work, I code for fun, watch Football and go to the gym.
