## Thesis Title: [Geogenic radon mapping of Hessen using Machine Learning Techniques](https://github.com/Madaar49/Masters_Thesis/tree/main)

## Overview

This research focused on spatial modelling of Geogenic radonpotential in Hessen District using machine learning techniques and environmental covariables. 

**Hypothesis :** It is hyothesizes that the spatial variability of geogenic radon is affected by environmental parameters related to soil, geology, meterology etc. Therefore, by modelling a relationship between known sampling points and their environmental co-variables, we can predict the radon potential in areas where the environmental co-variables are present but radon is unknown.


## Data and Method
- geogenic radonpotential sampling data.

- 38 covariates related to geology, soil, climate, Uranium, DEM etc.

- Use spatial cross validation for feature selection.

-  Develop models such as `Random Forest`, `xGBoost`, `Suport Vector Regressor`, `Multi-Layer-Perceptron Regressor`

## Deliverables

The code and workflow will be available after publication of the work.
