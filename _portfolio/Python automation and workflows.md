# Project Title : Automating the process of factsheet generation using python (**autofactsheet**)

## Overview

This task is part of the Hessian state radon strategy – which was a radon measurement campaign in Hessen to measure the radon concentration in soil and soil-gas. There are two main stakeholders in the project; the [Hessischen Landesamt für Naturschutz, Umwelt und Geologie (HLNUG)](https://www.hlnug.de/geologie/radon-in-hessen/geowissenschaftliche-begleitung-der-landesradonstrategie), and the Technische Hochschule Mittelhessen (THM) in Gießen at the [Hessischen Radonzentrum (HeRaZ)](https://www.thm.de/heraz/index.php). This task was part of the public relation strategy of the project, for locals in Hessen to be aware of radon in the environment.

*A factsheet* – in context to this project is a piece of document that contains essential information about the radon measurement for a particular measuring point.

# Project Title : hlnug-word-highlighter-app

## Overview

This project was done for [Hessischen Landesamt für Naturschutz, Umwelt und Geologie (HLNUG)](https://www.hlnug.de/geologie), to increase productivity during research and literature review od documents by staffs. 

Staff at the agency works with documents for literature review, among other tasks. The relevance of the document mostly depends on the frequency of keywords.

This app will therefore identify relevant documents so that literature reviews can be done at a much faster rate.

# Project Title : DEM downloader app

## Overview

Digital Elevation Models (DEM) are normally downloaded from several provided - the most common is the [Earth Explorer](https://earthexplorer.usgs.gov). One challenge faced with acquiring this data is that, the data is in the form of tiles and if a project area falls on different tiles, then a user must download all the tiles and perform some preprocessing functions (Clip and fill).

The project aimed at creating a DEM Downloader app, to automate this process of downloading and clipping the DEM data, to a users exact region of interest.
