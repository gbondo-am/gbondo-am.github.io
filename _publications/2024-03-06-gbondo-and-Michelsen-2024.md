excerpt: '<i>Groundwater<i/> plays an essential role in Africa and corresponding research is vital to resource management and long-term planning. However, the level of research output and the mode of international research collaboration on the continent have been questioned. In particular, cases of <i>Helicopter Research<i/> have been reported. The term implies that scientists from wealthy nations do research in lower-income countries without involving local collaborators.To investigate the phenomenon in a groundwater context, we performed a <i>bibliometric study<i/> by extracting and analyzing (meta)data from Clarivate’s Web of Science database for the time period 1991–2020. Here, we particularly focused on authors and their affiliations.The analysis showed that there is a pronounced intra-continental imbalance, and that much of the groundwater research output in Africa is produced by Egypt, Nigeria, South Africa, Tunisia, and Morocco – larger countries with a relatively high Gross Domestic Product. These nations apparently “own” their research, i.e., papers about groundwater in these countries include local (co-)authors (affiliation in the concerned country), or at least authors with an African affiliation. However, this does not apply to a number of other African countries, implying that local scientists do not spearhead corresponding studies which points towards helicopter research. To foster effective groundwater research and counteract the above-mentioned development, various players have to contribute, including local governments, funding organizations, individual researchers, but also journals.'
